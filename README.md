**A contacts app for [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org).**  

This is the new contacts app that has replaced the [old contacts app](https://github.com/owncloudarchive/contacts) with ownCloud 9.0, and is only the frontend for the new CardDAV-Backend which has moved into the [ownCloud Core](https://github.com/owncloud/core).
